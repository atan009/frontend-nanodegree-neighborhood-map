# frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map-Alex-Tan
This is the neighberhood map project that I completed for the Udacity course.<br>
It has 5 pinned locations that I would like to visit and picks a venue related to coffee for each one.<br>

## How to Run
Clone the repo or download the zip.<br>
In the repo/zip is an index.html file.<br>
Opening the index.html will run the webpage.<br>
Alternatively, use the github hosted [page](https://atan009.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map/).

On the top left is a filter button. <br>
Clicking this pulls a sidenav onto the screen.<br>
The text input box is a search filter for the 5 locations.<br>
The filter is not case sensitive and will match based on strings.<br>
Clicking a button or a marker on the map will open an infowindow about the venue.<br>

Google Maps API was used to implement main map system.<br>
w3schools, JSFiddle were used in reference to help with design.<br>
GitHub referencing consisted of using only the Udacity files provided and shown in videos.<br>
Foursquare API was used to acquire venue address information.<br>
